# Smart-Farming

## Overview

The Smart-Farming project leverages machine learning and IoT technologies to enhance agricultural practices. By integrating sensor data with advanced algorithms, the system aims to optimize crop yield prediction, disease detection, and irrigation management, thereby improving overall farm productivity.

## Features

- **Crop Yield Prediction**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to forecast crop yields based on environmental and historical data.  
- **Disease Detection**: Employs deep learning techniques to identify plant diseases from images, enabling timely intervention.  
- **Irrigation Optimization**: Analyzes soil moisture levels to automate irrigation schedules, conserving water and ensuring optimal plant growth.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **IoT Integration**: Sensor data collection and processing  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
