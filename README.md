Utilized various machine learning algorithms to develop a smart farming system, enhancing agricultural efficiency and productivity. Implemented techniques such as crop yield prediction, disease detection, and irrigation optimization using deep learning and IoT sensor data. Developed predictive models using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc.

## Key Features and Highlights

- Crop yield prediction using machine learning algorithms.
- Disease detection in plants through image processing.
- IoT sensor data integration for irrigation optimization.
- Utilization of deep learning techniques for enhanced accuracy.
- Models built using CNN, SVM, and other advanced algorithms.
