# Smart Farming System

## Overview
Smart Farming leverages machine learning and IoT to improve agricultural productivity. The system provides crop yield predictions, disease detection, and optimized irrigation recommendations using real-time data.

## Features
- **Crop Yield Prediction**: Predicts crop yields based on environmental and soil data.
- **Disease Detection**: Identifies plant diseases using deep learning and image processing.
- **Irrigation Optimization**: Suggests optimal watering schedules using sensor data.
- **IoT Integration**: Real-time monitoring with connected sensors.

## Technologies
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow, Arduino, Raspberry Pi

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gl1461/Smart-Farming.git
cd Smart-Farming
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Collect farm data using IoT sensors.
2. Train models for crop yield prediction and disease detection.
3. Input new data to get predictions and irrigation recommendations.

## Future Work
- Mobile app for farmers
- Web dashboard for data visualization
- Blockchain for secure tracking of crops
